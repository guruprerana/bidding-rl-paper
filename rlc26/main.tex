% AUTHOR: Fill in the following meta-data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\input{additional_preamble.tex}
\input{macros.tex}

% Enter the title of your paper:
\title{Divide and Coordinate: A Multi-Policy Framework for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning}

% The "running title" will be displayed in the header on every-other page.
% It is typically either the same as the title or a shorter version of the title.
% Enter your running title here:
\setrunningtitle{Multi-Objective RL With Multi-Agent Bidding}

% WARNING: Authors must not appear in the submitted version. They should be hidden
% as long as the rlj package is used without the [accepted] or [preprint] options.
% Non-anonymous submissions will be rejected without review.

% Enter the author names below. 
% NOTE: Denote affiliations using superscripts as in the provided example.
% NOTE: Use \textscript{1,2,3} instead of $^{1,2,3}$.
%       - Failure to do so will cause affiliation superscripts to appear on the cover page for camera-ready and preprint versions.
\author{Guruprerana Shabadi\textsuperscript{1}, Kaushik Mallik\textsuperscript{2}}

% NOTE: For camera-ready and preprint versions, the cover page includes author names but not affiliations.
% It automatically removes the superscripts for affiliations.
% If the automatic process breaks (e.g., if an author name should include a superscript), you can manually define the author string to appear on the cover page by uncommenting the following line.
%\coverPageAuthor{Marlos C. Machado, Philip S. Thomas, Lorem Ipsum}

% Author emails, which can be clustered if they have shared endings as in this example
\emails{shabadi@seas.upenn.edu, kaushik.mallik@imdea.org}

% Author affiliations, in the order the occur
% The inclusion of state/province, etc. is optional.
% The inclusion of multiple affiliations is optional.
%   - List multiple affiliations with comma-separated numbers as in the example.
\affiliations{
$^{1}$\textbf{University of Pennsylvania, United States}\\
$^{2}$\textbf{IMDEA Software Institute, Spain}
% The following two lines are optional and can be commented out
% \par % If including additional comments like below, use \par to add some whitespace. 
% $^\dagger$ Additional comments can be added like this, e.g., indicating equal contribution

\contribution{
    % Contribution
    Provide a succinct but precise list of the contribution(s) of the paper. Use contextual notes to avoid implications of contributions more significant than intended and to clarify and situate the contribution relative to prior work (see the examples below). If there is no additional context, enter ``None''. Try to keep each contribution to a single sentence, although multiple sentences are allowed when necessary. If using complete sentences, include punctuation. If using a single sentence fragment, you may omit the concluding period. A single contribution can be sufficient, and there is no limit on the number of contributions. Submissions will be judged mostly on the contributions claimed on their cover pages and the evidence provided to support them. Major contributions should not be claimed in the main text if they do not appear on the cover page. Overclaiming can lead to a submission being rejected, so it is important to have well-scoped contribution statements on the cover page.

% Define the summary that appears on the cover page.
\summary{The summary appears on the cover page. Although it can be identical to the abstract, it does not have to be. One might choose to omit the stated contributions in the Summary, given that they will be stated in the box below. The original abstract may also be extended to two paragraphs. The authors should ensure that the contents of the cover page fit entirely on a single page. The cover page does \textbf{not} count towards the 8--12 page limit.
